# Car-sensor-simulator
Welcome to the MIPS Car Sensor System Simulation! This program simulates a car sensor system,  allowing you to input and update sensor readings for temperature, speed, and fuel level. The program  includes range checks and warnings to alert you if any input falls outside expected values.
