# Car-sensor-simulator
Welcome to the MIPS Car Sensor System Simulation! This program simulates a car sensor system,  allowing you to input and update sensor readings for temperature, speed, and fuel level. The program  includes range checks and warnings to alert you if any input falls outside expected values.
Instructions to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have a MIPS assembler and simulator installed on your system. MARS MIPS simulator 
can be used. A. Download and install the MARS MIPS simulator from [MARS 
Website](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm).
B. Open MARS, load the MIPS program file (`carsensorsimulator4.asm`)
2. Or Copy and paste the provided MIPS assembly code into a file with a .asm extension.
3. Assemble and run the code using your preferred MIPS tool.
Range Checks and Warnings
The program includes range checks and warnings for the following sensor readings:
• Temperature:
• Minimum: 34°F
• Maximum: 100°F
• Warning: Displays if the temperature exceeds the expected range.
• Speed:
• Maximum: 65 mph
• Warning: Displays if the speed exceeds the maximum limit.
• Fuel Level:
• Minimum: 2 gal
• Warning: Displays if the fuel level falls below the expected level.
Additional Features
1. User Interaction:
• The program prompts you to enter initial sensor readings and provides the option to 
update them.
2. Multiple Readings:
• After entering initial readings, the program asks if you want to enter more sensor 
readings.
3. Warning Messages:
• If any sensor reading falls outside the expected range, a warning message is displayed.
4. Temperature and Speed Units:
• Temperature is displayed in degrees Fahrenheit, and speed is displayed in miles per hour.
Sample Execution
1. Run the program.
2. Enter initial sensor readings when prompted.
3. View the initial sensor readings with temperature, speed, and fuel level and any warning 
messages.
4. Choose whether to update the sensor readings.
5. If updating, enter new sensor readings.
6. View updated sensor readings and any warning messages.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 if more readings are desired.
8. The program will exit when you choose not to enter more readings.
